# sign-up-portal-with-authentication
This is a simple practical exercise of a sign up page together with its authentication
this is the link of my api https://git.heroku.com/alovegasignup-api-heroku.git hosted in heroku
I have implemented the same app using ORM in my signUP_ORM repository you can refer it there and test it its up and running
